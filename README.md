This repository contains code, data, and resources for the Exoplanet Network Analysis project. 
The goal of this project is to apply network analysis techniques to the study of exoplanets, with a focus on 
understanding the relationships between different physical properties and observables.

## Data Sources
- NASA Exoplanet Archive: Planetary Systems Composite Parameters Table (PSCompPars)
  - include parameters from a variety of references for a given planet, indicating the set of reported 
  parameter values may not be internally or physically self-consistent.
- 

## Intended contents

The repository contains the following items:

- `data/`: A directory containing the compiled data on over 5,000 exoplanets, including properties such as mass, radius, temperature, and more.
- `code/`: A directory containing Python scripts for performing network analysis on the exoplanet data. This includes code for constructing networks, computing network metrics, and visualizing the results.
- `resources/`: A directory containing additional resources for the project, such as documentation, presentations, and publications.
- README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Usage

To use the code and data in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the Python 
scripts in the `code/` directory. The scripts are designed to be modular and easy to use, and should work out of the 
box with the provided data.
